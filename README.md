### ‚öõÔ∏è Intro
Collection of data science projects aimed at practicing and improving my skills in the field.
Project ideas are taken from Kaggle, Udemy, Coursera and material freely available on the internet.
I try to reference all the code, courses and blogs I use to take inspiration and build my own work.
I apologise for any missing reference or citation. For any complaint, need or curiosity, feel free 
to contact me at the following e-mail address: villa.emilio1994@gmail.com .

### üìä List of projects
- **titanic**: a deep dive into the famous Kaggle competition *Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster*
  (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).
  The aim of the notebook is to perform *Data Mining* and *Feature Engineering* on the original dataset
  to extract additional information and improve model performance.

- **bike_sharing**: a notebook that performs the forecast of the use of a city bikeshare system. Data are taken from
  the Kaggle competition *Bike Sharing Demand* (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bike-sharing-demand/overview). 
  In the modelling part of the notebook, model explainability using SHAP is discussed.

- **lstm_rnn**: a short notebook that shows the limitations of Recurrent-Neural-Networks (RNN) architectures 
  when it comes to long distance memory patterns. A set of sequences is created and each sequence is labelled according 
  first to a short memory strategy, after to a long memory strategy. Performances of RNN and Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) 
  in learning the two labelling strategies are compared. 

- **cnn_filters**: a short notebook to get an insight into what filters of a Convolutional-Neural-Network (CNN) 
  look for in an input image. 

- **wiki_joke**: a web app available at https://emilz.pythonanywhere.com/ that
  allows to generate *two jokes* starting from the content of a Wikipedia page using a Large Language Model (LLM).
