### Intro
Collection of data science projects aimed at practicing and improving my skills in the field.
Project ideas are taken from Kaggle, Udemy, Coursera and material freely available on the internet.
I try to reference all the code, courses and blogs I use to take inspiration and build my work on.
I apologise for any missing reference or citation. For any complaint, need or curiosity, feel free 
to contact me at the following e-mail address: villa.emilio1994@gmail.com .

### list of projects
- **titanic**: a deep dive into the famous Kaggle competition *Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster*
  (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic).
  The aim of the notebook is to perform *Data Mining* and *Feature Engineering* on the original dataset
  to extract additional information and improve model performance.

- **bike_sharing**: a notebook that performs the forecast of the use of a city bikeshare system. Data are taken from
  the Kaggle competition *Bike Sharing Demand* (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bike-sharing-demand/overview). 
  In the modelling part of the notebook, model explainability using SHAP is discussed.

- **lstm_rnn**: a short notebook that shows the limitations of RNN architectures when it comes to long distance
  memory patterns. A set of sequences is created and each sequence is labelled according first to a short memory
  strategy, after to a long memory strategy. Performances of RNN and LSTM in learning the two labelling strategies
  are compared. 

- **cnn_filters**: a short notebook to get an insight into what filters of a CNN look for in an
  input image. 

- **dashboard**: a minimal interactive dashboard available at https://emilz.pythonanywhere.com/ that
  shows the difference between *underfit* and *overfit* using a simple linear model.
