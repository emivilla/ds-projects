### Intro
Collection of data science projects aimed at practicing and improving my skills in the field.

### list of projects
- **titanic**: a deep dive into the famous Kaggle competition *Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster*.
  The aim of the notebook is to perform *Data Mining* and *Feature Engineering* on the original dataset
  to extract additional information and consequently to have a gain in model performance.
- **lstm_rnn**: a short notebook to show the limitations of RNN architectures when it comes to long distance
  memory patterns. A set of sequences is created and each sequence is labelled according first to a short memory
  strategy, after to a long memory strategy. Performances of RNN and LSTM in learning the two labelling strategies
  are compared. 
- **cnn_filters**: 
- **dashboard**:
